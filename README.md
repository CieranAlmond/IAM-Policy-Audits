# IAM-Policy-Audits
Policy as Code lab provided by Ashley Pearce - www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-thornhill

In this lab, you’re going to uncover hidden dangers in your infrastructure as code (IaC). Specifically, we’re going to focus on IAM policies which are little blocks of JSON that either lock your environment down tight or blow the doors wide open.

By the end of this walkthrough, you'll be able to:

Detect risky permissions before they hit production
Understand how Rego policies work and how to write them
Use Conftest to scan for security violations
Learn why wildcard permissions and shared accounts are a bad time
Build your confidence as a GRC engineer with hands-on skills that matter
This lab is designed for folks who’ve never written a line of code before, but who are ready to start making sense of the alphabet soup of IAM, Rego, and policy enforcement.

No AWS credentials, no fancy tooling. Just GitHub Codespaces and your brain.
